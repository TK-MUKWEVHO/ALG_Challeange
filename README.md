Given a range from a given whole number a to some given maximum whole number b, as well as some given whole number q (that represents a batching constant), then:
        1. Print out the sum of every batch of numbers q; and
        2. Print out the sum of all whole numbers from a to the last number in that batch.
Please validate your input parameters a, b, q as follows:

Example:
    For a = 101, b = 500, q = 40 your program must output:
